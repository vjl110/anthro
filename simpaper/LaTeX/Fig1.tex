\caption{Circles represent actors in the simulation and bars represent the kinship links between them.  The larger circles in the third generation represent care-giving offspring.  Solid lines show residence independent caring relationships, while dotted lines show caring relationships unique to the natal household.  Note, the number of offspring starts at 0 and grows throughout the simulation.}
